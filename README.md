Sharing requirements in order to make Visual Studio for Mac as good as Visual Studio for Windows.


## What is this?
Here I share a list of features that are either currently missing in Visual Studio for Mac or that aren't well designed.

My goal is to make Visual Studio for Mac as good as Visual Studio for Windows.


## Why?
I happen to work on both the Windows and the Mac platforms. When Visual Studio for the Mac was announced, I was so excited.
Unfortunately, I was so desappointed by the product as it doesn't receive the same love from Microsoft as Visual Studio for Windows or Visual Studio Code.

Thus, when I have to switch from Windows to the Mac, it is very frustrating not to have the same (great) experience I have with Visual Studio for Windows.

I simply want to have the same experience whether I work on the Windows or on the Mac platforms.


## What is wrong with Visual Studio Code?
Absolutely nothing! 

But, as when I work on the Windows platform (where I can have a full-fledged Visual Studio **AND** a lighter Visual Studio Code), I want to have that same choice on the Mac platform. 


## Call to contribution!
If, like me, you loved the idea of having a full-fledged Visual Studio on the Mac platform, feel free to contribute to this list. I shared it with Microsoft.

Happy contibuting ! :)
